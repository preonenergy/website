                Solar Electricity is the best way to power your home or business that benefits the environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                We feel proud to say that India is the leading generators of solar energy in the world due to our ideal
                geographical sunlight.
                The country receives tropical sunlight and has clear skies for up to 300 days every year.
                Our country’s solar installed capacity reached 35.12 GW as of 30 June 2020 which is two years ahead of
                schedule.
                The account of rooftop solar power is 2.1 GW, in which 70% is industrial or commercial.

                The resulted benefit of the solar power is extremely beneficial – not only for environment but also for
                a
                private economy.
                - Saves money in the long run as it cuts electricity bills
                - Reduces carbon footprints
                - Low maintenance costs
                - Government schemes

                    from Rooftop Solar Projects by the year 2022. In this regard, central financial assistance for the
                    residential sector
                    will be 40% for RTS systems up to 3 kW capacity and 20% for RTS systems with 3 kW- 10 kW capacities.
